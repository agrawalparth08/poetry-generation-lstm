Fishy Business
Man's got bigger fish 
To fry,
Leaving the smaller fish 
To Die,
Still always wondering
Sadness, why.
If livin's easy,
Dying's an escape.
If being normal is easy,
Put on the cape.
If being fat is easy,
Shed all the shape.
If speaking is easy,
Lay down the tape.

The One Who Was Meant To Be-

When I became we
Nothing seemed difficult 
The world was indeed made of rainbows
Of unicorns and extra crispy french fries
You made me complete
Yet somehow the darkness never left
For the wounds had never healed
Grey hid behind the curtain of colors
Wanting to crush the horn of hope
I wanted to be me again
For the inverted M was never meant to be.
You took my heart and put it right
It was but my mind dwelling on the sorrows of past
My broken teeth, my swollen soul
Fight had already boarded the flight
The one overbooked with my emotions
It was never supposed to fly again
Yet you were the pilot of my dreams
My defence against destiny
I hope to be your knight in shining armour
But you are the one who was meant to be.

Letters of Love (LoL)
It was love
At hundred and first sight
Two years in college
We got engaged all right
Away she went putting the ring on hold
While I wrote her letters in bold
Two times four times twelve times two
Night seemed darker and day blue
We tied the knot in broad daylight
192 letters needed a rewrite
It was after years I found
One of them lying around
My kids were giggling
Flowers in my mind of yesteryear's spring
I asked her if she's got the stash
None of your business, mister. It's my cache.
But it was I who bled my heart
Once you delivered them ,they became my part.
I wonder if I should hire a lawyer to get the letters
Silly things written in love are worth 100 acres.

The Moving Train
After thirty years
of teaching history,
She reached out to him
a million times,
The kids went away
To study and to earn a name
Her history kept her moving
in the tear drops of rain.
She belonged to her students
and never felt sane,
The commute of life took away
Years she could have spent
being there when it mattered.
Space is a luxury not to be given;
Unless you hide from pain.
He saw her gliding through the train's coach
Could have hugged her tight
But he found himself
on the wrong side of the platform.
The train had left
but a fragment of her behind,
Her dreams had been achieved
through other people in her life.
"What will I do when I retire"
she used to quip to him everyday
So much to read and write, he would say.
Have done my fair share, said her mind
Yet she believed there was still time,
Time to make things right.

Fight or Fluight
To erase a cloud hidden
He went up the ladder
Chaos was waiting
To help a lending hand
The birds flu away
One came along
His help was unwelcoming
Megadeath his band
Things got deleted 
Memories got corrupt
A beam broke through
Cloudburst and emotions erupt
Its easy to let go
Difficult to understand
Droplets fall on face
And sometimes in vein they race

Father,
He grew up without one
Alive yet away
Catching breath was easy,
A ball, not really.
In Jonty he found
The Rhodes of life.
Puberty hits hard
But Rocky trained his fists
The grass of face grew thick and bold
Moustachey Roger backhand 
Was the best a man could get
He learned to love in Casablanca
And to laugh in modern times
The pain never made him cry
Yet seeing father-son bond on screen would.
He was never alone 
Yet hollow inside.
The mode of communication being
Whatsapp forwards and inspirational videos
The day father returned
His hands lay numb and face so calm
His last message read,
“Before you know it, they’ll be grown
You kiss goodnight to that baby
Every chance you get”

Fear of missing out
There is so much to see
So much to do,
We do it for others
When the moon is blue.
We feel alone
in the world of snaps,
Stories aren't told
They disappear in a day.
Memories fade we groan
Relations difficult to hold.
Still we cling to life
The one wiating for us
Somebody's sister,someone's wife
Love is online,
s"mothered" offline.
Feeling loved is not enough
'Tis the age of doubt
We celebrate, we dance
In fear of missing out.

Revenge and Morose
Tough to avoid
Easy to take
Its the cold dish
The angry asteroid.

Getting back at
Is not the challenge
Having one's 
The real deal.

Red erupts
Life corrupts
Vulnerable naked self
Still thirsty for revenge?

The Meeting Place

Hanging by a thread
We find love 
In dreams we never had.

We dream through their eyes
Live enough to chase them
Till the last sunrise.

Who are you?
Kimi na no wa.

My fairy tale.

Life is better;
When I think of your gleeful eyes,
Just when I see a newborn child,
While I sleep next to your smiling face.

Life is tough;
When I have no one to share my victories with,
Just because we were never best friends,
While I slept on my hand to not feel alone.

Life is hilarious;
When you pretend to be my super nerd,
Just because you'd sometimes shop in the kid's section,
While I ran past the fitness freaks in the morning,
To see twilight fall on your hair.

Life is
When I write
Just to hold onto your memory
While I dream a little more.

The Crack Before Dawn

Some have it easy,
Some have it rough,
In heartbreak one finds solace
In tears we find love.
The blink of an incoming message,
The flood inside my heart.
Replace the old with new
Replace the memories inside
Perhaps it was for the best
Perhaps maybe leave out all the rest

Head's Up

My dear dream,
Hiding behind the shadows
Dancing on petals concealed
I lay down on the bed
And you arise from slumber
Enlightening me
Towards threats unknown
Nudging me
In a maze herculean
Guiding me
To the hidden world,
A world radiant enough
for this moth to burn
A dream worthy enough
To chin up to the music. 

The Cart

My build miniature
Adventures though colossal
I may be ordinary
My balloons are not.
Some hanging by a thread,
Some soaring towards the silent night
A trade occurs and they depart.
Filling the gap our society can not
With gleaming smiles and empty stomachs.
One sleeps inside, one fools around
The father hustles for a bread half pound.
I may be small,
I may be in shambles,
I might creak in pain
I might smile in rain,
Everyday I go out
To let them know
Humanity awaits
At the end of the road.

MissMeNot
We run away from our troubles
Our fears, our dears
Wishing our lives are filled 
with colors nice and shiny.
Each corner echoes
the tender intimate warmth
We wish to be alone
Yet yearning for the hand 
which once fed you love
The one amongst the crowd of many
The many-bangled girl

Pain-TingTingTing!

I dream a dream so white and blue
A dusty cloud came near and grew
Sand in my feet wind in my hair
Through paintings memories I share.

A dusty ball rolled over into the sea
I gathered the colors to paint the ball
Another ball washed ashore, bigger and bouncy
Someone had replaced poor dusty

Disheartened yet determined
Dusty didn't stop rolling
He became a mountain in someone else's painting
I was but a child marching to my own beats.

I missed the snow so I made it fall
A beach to quench my thirst
My legs so tiny, my heart so small
I thought I was good,
but you're the worst.

Fallacy

Life ends at the edge of the road,
The fall may be our last.

We all made our choices
Some strong, some weak branches
We may have risen from the ashes
But the fall may be our last.

The mountains are but far
Some scaled, some avoided
Kept us going in days so gloomy
The fall maybe our darkest night.

Layers upon layers we peeled
Of people who came and loved
We could have stopped them from leaving
The fall is the one to blame

Lush green bed awaits at the bottom
The fall is just the beginning

Little by Little
His heart became brittle
A goodbye was promised
By an alchemist unknown

Inch by Inch
His stature grew
The bricks turned orange
A visit was overdue

Piece by Piece
He broke her down
The beauty remained
The beast had gone

Brick by Brick
The alchemist was paid in gold
He encrypted a moon in marble
To date we wonder about his magic trick.

Life in a NUTshell

My dear celery
You cost a lot of penne
You were supposed to bake
My life butter

My wallet can't ketchup
A petite so wholesome
Cantaloupe this noodley world
Bonus cannoli save my life

Its a dog eat dog world
I can only let the chips fall
Honey,do turnip the music
We don't carrot all.

Who am I, in the eyes of most people?
A Nobody; a non existent entity.
Someone who has not and never will have
any one position in the society.
Inshort, the lowest of the lows.
Well then,even if that were all absolutely true,
then one day I will have to show by my work 
what this nobody,
this non-entity has in his heart. 

Every year the box opens,
Some kites are added,
Some remain wounded.

The kite doctor treats them well
Gives the rocket a shredded bell
Each has a story to tell.

They kiss the skies too high
and fall to the ground so low
Some rebel, others defy.

My dear box I tie you again the day after
For it shall hold my childhood dear
Through kites, my dreams soar
Through thread, my life restored. 

HiFi!

Music inside all of us
Yet we fail to see,
Talent feeds the tornado inside
Silver keeps the fire burning.

Passion, Perseverance,Proficiency
All they see is pity
Not all can pay the piper
And get out of this fallacy

Smile and the world giggles
Cry and the nature consoles
Copper rains in purple hue
Something numb and something blue

He decides to settle the score
Moulding his heart with bitter ore
The world is full of flair but,
We have no time to stand and stare.

Satisfying Con - Trolls

We wish to meet new people
Talk to strangers
Have new experiences
Smile away to the chirpy beetle.

We feel society stops us
Controls our emotions
But we want their likes
On our photos superflous

You may talk to strangers
Ignore the ones who care
Not all are controlling
Some always remember you in their prayers.

If I die today
I wont be known as the one who loved
I'd be known as the one who controlled
But my fate was already sealed
When I stopped to let you go.

Hold on to the memories
Pin them down in your heart
It may repair your broken soul,
Piece by piece make you whole,
Life is fair, people are just,
Look in the right direction, we must.

Edgey Evening

Somewhere over the horizon I see
The place meant for me
Somewhere in between
Lies the mysterious sea.

A song sung so high above
Splits the seas in two
One shapes memories of sorrow
Other a dancing tree

I see the promised land
Consuming the wrath of rain
I wish the clouds goodbye
For they were not meant for me.

The promised land is here
I wish to be free
A call comes from the other side
You were never meant to be.

Stay

Life gives us bricks to make walls,
No one said where,
Some build monuments of glory,
Some erect them in their hearts.
A wall was asked once
What keeps it up at night,
It laughed back and said
Words and memories of glee,
Everybody pays a fee
Not everyone is supposed to play a part in your life,
The ink may fade into oblivion,
And the story unfinished,
What may remain for people to stare,
Writings on the wall,
Castles in the air.

Running in the sand
Crashing with the waves
Floating through the world
Is a giant turtle in a cave.

He hides
Behind the mistakes of past,
As the wick turns to ash
Diaries of yesterday he holds fast.

Once upon a time
The river flew full
He swam, he jostled
For life had no rule

He looks towards the ocean
To seek solace
All he can find is that
The water doesn't race.

He goes in his shell to find 
The missing part numb
The puzzle may complete the big picture
But you still need a pair to play the drum.

Incomplete he feels
Desolation prevails
Waning with the sun,
Is a giant turtle in the cave.

Maze

We often feel lost - 
In thoughts that betray,
On untravelled roads being gray.
But when you get lost
In a person's life,
You figure out a way
To beat the maze.

You can meet a billion people
But only one can be your maze
The one in which you can be lost forever,
The one who is worth the chase.

Aglet

The little match girl
Who painted a picture so clear
The world could be seen
In the shoes so clean.

That winter was long 
Yet she waited for the sun
She wanted to show the world
That I am a rainbow too 
November rains
Those fickle beauties
Made her sing a song so great
The world around could barely accomodate

She died the day after 
Burning bright with fever so high
Best are the movies
With no happy endings
No pain to feel,
No sorrow to gain.

Moondance

Meet me at the river's end for;
A song needs to be sung,
Mend, append, pretend my friend,
Thumping hearts, beating drums;
A night to remember, a song to be sung.

Tower by the sea

I wish there was a way to know
How much in life do I owe,
Curiously I climb the tower of jenga
Only to fall into a pool of magenta.

Head over heels over a pretty ballerina
Storms came but I held down the fort,
She was messy, I was Argentina.

But God cast a shining spell
My head contorting over the carousel
Fire raged on the banks of still waters
One, Two, Three then came the marauders.

All I ever wanted was
To walk across the hill,
To know those were my good days
To gift the world one last daffodil.

The Flower Hawker

When the cows moo
And the prayer bells ring,
He cycles his way through
The morning tring.

Be it january or june
Flowers sway to his tune
Greeting with a smiling face
For he has sadness to erase.

His health is always in pink
His bench is always clean and white,
Collecting colors to gain green
Ends up everyday gathering marigold.

He whips up the best 
Spots me from a mile away,
An unspoken transaction takes place
Bunch of reds for a penny's pay.

Some toss coins,
Some read horoscopes,
I know my day will be well
If i get that smile
And a pretty crimson glory rose.

The Postman

The doorbell rings
But there is no one around
He slides it below the door
Without making a sound.

Letters of love
Notes of distress
Some delayed
Altogetherly delivered

The rugged clothes have withstood
Rains and hurricanes
All they ask for in return
A sign on a wooden pane.

A stranger to none
Yet familiar to all
Amidst the furry's fury
Always ready to play ball.

Letters, catalogues, notices
May get replaced by email,
The postman can't be replaced
For they deliver hope,
They care.

PaperGal

Why do we wake up?
Is it hope of future
Or righting the wrongs of past?
Daily chores and music to our ears,
Early walk executed in our brains
While we come back to our senses,
We hear a loud thud
No, poets don't fall
Papers do,
The dawn of news
Ricocheting from our wind chimes,
Orchestrated to hide beneath 
The crevices left untouched,
The paper gal hits the target
Which no one else sees.

Methodical Madness

A storm brews inside
Before the mayhem is unleashed,
Our mind is satisfied
When the beast is set free.

Things may calm us
People may hurt us
Life may beat us
But the beast can't be contained.

Blindsided by our egos
Backed into a corner
Our true nature, restrained
Our egos, altered.

Moral compasses shatter
North Stars vanish
Is this the real life
Or just a sad, mad world.

A world marked for madness,
A world where pandemonium prevails.
The world of Devil.

Belligerent Box

Its tough to find the right place
Fitting into the world is rough.

We tape ourselves shut
Slaming our doors in defiance,
Some are easy to crack
A few are tough nut.

Once the floodgates open
We are all the same
A pile of emotions stacked up
A wandering soul without an aim.

Hitting the mat is just the beginning
Inner walls need to be resurrected
We live to be boxed another day
Out for delivery, subject to delay.

Clumsy Cloud

A new day, a new yawn
Darts of sunlight beaming at dawn,
Never predict where I will be next,
As I wait for the ringmaster's text.

Even my body has 70 percent water,
Sometimes more than more,
Jettier the black, bigger the hoarder
Made of cotton heavier than iron ore।

I wish to be more transparent,
But secrets we need to hide,
Camouflaging my love I condescend,
Tears don't fall they get electrified.

We merge, diverge, converge in a day,
Dangling our sorrows in shades of gray,
Sorrow permeates, joy disseminates
while we wait for the silver lining
to come and play,
Its cloudy boy-o,
With a chance of rain

Beamish Bear

Be here in the present
To learn a lesson,
Affection is pleasant
When life gives us lemons.

Acknowledge people 
For the good they do,
Hold their hands
When mistakes are due.

Clutch their fingers tight
Let them know you are there 
Spare a little gray in white
Bare a little, forbear.

The hand that gives meaning
May soon fade away
All that is left behind
Ruffled hair, eyes weeping.

Philosophical Potboiler

As the sun rises,
Everyone compromises;
We wake up with hunger
To be a little younger.

The lost games,
The flings and flames,
Weekends and mother's bawl
Curled up in a blanket tall.

Ceilings different,
bright and dull
Replaced by dark mirror
But charging's null.

Nostalgia, friendship
Love and life,
Living in the words of others
While we clip our feathers

What does one earn
With a single like
Mike Oscar November Echo Yankee
Haven't seen a friggin dime!

Implosion

Why do we keep going back
To places of pain
Challenging rage to take over
Destroying peace of mind, 
No restrain.

Machines may learn 
From mistakes past,
Humans fail to comply.

Like moth to the lamp
We fly and defy,
Thoughts to deny
Pain to personify.

Excelsior

When nothing
Is going your way,
They say,
When its not your time,
Its not your time.
I didn't ask
to be buried under sea,
to be bit by a spider,
to have a hole in my heart.
All I asked,
was to create a world,
A world for misfits,
A universe to live.
Rest now, O silent green beast.

Mountain Mail

A ship sails
Over the red mountain
And a winter mundane,
Here lies spring,
Conceited in a veil.

As the bag drops
In the serene hue,
Some letters escape
To tell their tale.

She was his Taj
He was his haram,
But the one 
Who writes destinies
Left out one detail.

A moon to gift,
A smile to remember,
He made it to the top
A bit too late,
To his sealed fate.
A face to remember,
A place to sail.

HyphenSeparatedValue

Hold on -
To the dreams you chase,
Pass on -
The knowledge you get,
Go on -
To the edge of the horizon,

Game on -
Seek the challenging phase,
Carry on -
With the baggage of regret,
Move on -
From teary words to hyphens,

Give up -
Before its too late,
Stand up -
Fight the inner rage,
A world divided -
By caste and race,
An emotion divided-
By a space

Restricted Airspace

If you are easy to forget
then you did something right.
We all are but living 
On borrowed time.

Lend a hand,
Borrow a book.
Get people on demand,
Not to love, but only to look.

Filtering noise is easy,
Its the echo inside
which chips away,
pound for pound,
Day by day.

Screams to let out,
Deep breaths to take,
Alive online,
for borrowed lives' sake.

A Clumsy Day

Alarm missed,
Sure.
Waking 2 minutes before one,
Disaster.
Hot Shower,
Mon amour!
Forgetting towel outside,
Shivering plaster.

A rose falls on your cheek,
Today's my day.
Cat scratches on your dry skin,
Nope, not today.
Will listen to that audiobook on the way,
Sinful janx spirit!
Mobile's asleep on the bed at home,
Curse you, McDuck!

What a productive work day,
Dilbert's happy.
You have 0 new messages screen read in the evening,
My anxieties have anxieties.
She will probably read the poem, I suppose.
A guy can hope,
Nope, Nope, Nope.

The side mirror

To forgotten chats
and incomplete association,
I wish to ask this dubious question,
How do you know when it ends,
The book of life with a broken pen.

Waking up with a poem new
Messages used to wait in queue,
Like leaves in autumn ready to fall,
Pepsi Cola candies, November rainfall.

From madly in love
To a broken man,
Friendships so strong
Forgotten wingman.

All it takes is a wake up call
One wrong steer into the wall
Is the path to blame, I question
You have a new friend suggestion.

The Peacock and the Sun

Sitting in an empty room
A picteresque view to consume
Amongst the green and hay
Eyespots in a circular array

Out comes a neck so majestic
While the sun becomes poetic
What is your iridescence without me
Only good for a mediocre saree.

The peacock snaps its neck in return
Screaming by the silly fern
See that man by the window
Do you see him breaking into a crescendo?

We are but a figment of imagination
The bang that made us might even take us
Why burn so bright in rage,
Come lets give the man something to gaze.

The man is but a slave
To worries of work and fame,
While the sun sets to rise,
The peacock provides the flame.

Shrinkosaurus

There was young man going to thinland,
He had bought two flight tickets to expand,
Suddenly he had an appetite loss,
Because adjacent upon hypotenuse is cos,
So he joined the scranton band

ShatterStar

The day you realise
Happiness is just a state of mind
A star falls to remind you
Nothing lasts forever,
Kid.

Yet you yearn for yellow youth
One last offer to refuse 
Urges to undo,
Relive the adieu.

Stand with someone under the shade
Train today, talk tomorrow
Always chin up, don't be afraid
Regret later, vanquish sorrow
Seal your own fate.

To old and the new

Verse I

Chilly winds swept her feet
The kid scanned the bus
For an empty seat
Staff only, it said

Feeling out of place,
The kid started the chase
But the bus is empty, whiskered the kid
Company policy, said the driver.

If he takes us, he has to take em all
A tail wiggled from under the shawl
They walked away from the sun
The tail grew in numbers
For the tale had just begun.

Verse II

For a few feet far
A door came ajar
Come take shelter said the old man
Came to a halt the ragtag caravan.

Out came the tails 
Some male, some pale.
Only one wiggled and stayed
Others had enough of this charade.

Your grandpa stayed with me
After endless quarrels and debris
Its difficult to let go kiddo
You realise things when you are widowed.

Everyone does their job
Some do it kindly,
Some always sob.

The ones who stay 
when things go wrong
Bad things sometimes they might say
The thread may break, 
Love may loose.
Hang on tight,
Sing it along.

Verse III

The Swan Song

Letters were written
We were bitten
To adventures and new places
Worn out shoe laces
Tiptoing to the closets
Magical dimensional pockets
We fell in the niagara fall
And waltzed over the great wall
I wish I knew those were the days
The days of old, castles of clay.

The Golden Leaf

As she sang the song,
Life began to drift apart
Memories flooded her soul and heart
It was time, for her to depart.

Her voice echoed throughout the galaxy
An eternal smile, gleaming
It was this moment of serenity,
A moment when stars are born.

The cat's tail stood up
Like an arrow 
Aiming at the sky,
A golden leaf fell underneath
A glistening gamut of goodbye.

If only tears could fill
The void in his little life,
A shadow emerged 
From a source unknown,
The leaf withered
Into a silent cyclone.

Unfinished business

The shadow stayed with the kid
For years on his back it hid
The day came when he fell in love
Tears fell that day from above

They went on adventures
Big and blue
Mistakes made, broken ties
Mortal enemies quarreling crew
Tears again fell
Not from above
But from within
Their story, fin.

Love was easy,
Forgiveness is rare
Trust was real
Words could repair.
Now I know why grandma said
Hang on tight,
Don't let go kiddo,
Someday you will reunite,
Fight the darkness with light.

The shadow dissapeared into the night
As the star burned beaming bright,
He boarded the bus for the final ride.

Merchant Of Hope

Life passes unnoticed 
Appreciate inspiring work
In words and people

City Of Science

You grow up
Be it the balloon and cup

You remember things
Or the quantum entangled strings

Places of elegance
Cutouts of scientists of eminence

Places of magic
Electrifying rides full of static

The islands of lemurs
The city filled with dreamers,

On a picnic with squirrels and flute,
Curious cats and paper parachutes.

A day with Turtle

Bathing in sunlight
He wishes to see the moon
Failed attempt at theft

Color Block

Pearly white pyjamas
Doing same old bronze dramas,
Driving in a canary sedan
With hazelnut tan.

Her mahogany stuck lips
A feathery rouge mesh hat
Perishing periwinkle boots beseeching,
What's up, teal
Haven't seen you in cerulean blue.

O, I live in a cave, madam
Where magic comes to light
Went a back to black for a while,
Aged perfectly, with wisdom wine.

MilesToGo

Stopped at a milestone
Looked into the future far
Retire when ahead

Catgrin on a tin ~
Scars so deep
Happy memories asleep
Promises to keep
Tears to sweep.

Made you smile
Made you cry
All this while
You were dissatified.

White or grey
Doesn't matter today
Nothing to weigh
Just walkaway.

Seek To Hide

Let the wind blow
The echoes away
Lets plug in the audio
And run faraway.

Hiding under ember's glow
Burning gently into the night
Welcome to the jitterbug studio
For a discussion erudite

You may wish to stay
Or catch a glance
You might be lucky today,
To win
A chance 
To finance
The romance.

Coincidental Accident

Some days we know
The signs from universe
Are not enough.

But the patterns remain,
intricately woven
In our beehive minds.

A name in a movie,
A missed call
A motif to be drawn.

Retrograding to the time
When things made sense
The mind was but a pawn
Infatuated and infected,
By fallacies of mortal soul.

Acquaintance in Abundance

I run towards the morning sun
Only to find headlamps bright
Posters, oranges, hopes and smiles
In abundance I pack.

Where do I live some ask;
On a concrete bed with potholes
Under the north star
With a tabby cat with crescent scar

Is this real life some ask;
We are what we empthasize with
Honk, curse, rush and fall
All we are but a face, hanging;
Amidst the bedlam, full of chaos.

Hi, biscus

Chivalry and Shrivelry,
Heroic and Stoic,
Why pluck a new leaf
from the tree of life,
Take an old petal, chief;
Wrinkled with wisdom,
Rich with rife.

End of the line

Every day ends,
Yet life bills are put on boards.

Hiding in virtual,
In reality, we fold.

Life may be on the fast lane,
At the end of the tunnel, we need someone to hold.

It's a bird. 
It's a plane.
It's just another blip.
In the skies unknown.

Moving away from merryland
Into the grey
To make mistakes,
To fall prey.

Prey to desires,
Prey to fame,
It's a bird,
Waiting to become a plane.
